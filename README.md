## **📌 About the Project**
This repository explores the fundamentals of **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, a deep learning architecture used for generating realistic data. It covers key concepts, implementation, and experiments to understand how GANs generate synthetic data.

💡 **What you’ll find here:**  
✅ **Basic GAN Architecture** (Generator & Discriminator)  
✅ **PyTorch Implementation** 🏗  
✅ **Training a GAN on Simple Datasets** 📊  
✅ **Visualization of Generated Data** 🎨

## **📖 Introduction**
A **GAN** consists of two neural networks:  
1️⃣ **Generator** 🏗 - Creates synthetic data to mimic real samples.  
2️⃣ **Discriminator** 🔍 - Evaluates whether the data is real or fake.  

Both networks compete in a **zero-sum game**, improving each other iteratively.

## **⚙️ Installation & Setup**
1️⃣ **Clone the repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Usmanbaraya/GAN-Basics.git
cd GAN-Basics
```
2️⃣ **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)**  
```bash
python -m venv gan_env
source gan_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use: gan_env\Scripts\activate
```
3️⃣ **Install dependencies**  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## **🚀 Usage**
Run the **GAN training script**:  
```bash
python train.py
```
This will train a basic GAN model on the dataset and generate synthetic samples.

🛠 **For detailed step-by-step execution**, check out the Jupyter notebooks inside the `notebooks/` folder.
